# Introduction

## Infra & Ops Security track

This track is created to cover the basics of infrastructure security and management. As developers are more pushed into the shift left way of working and thus are deploying and configuring infrastructure. This guide gives a basic view of the elements required to make a comprehensive secure infrastructure and configuration.

Network penetration testing has been a common technique used to test network security for decades. It is also commonly known as black-box testing or ethical hacking. Penetration testing is essentially the "art" of testing a system remotely to find security vulnerabilities, without knowing the inner workings of the target itself. Typically, the penetration test team is able to access an application as if they were users. The tester acts like an attacker and attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

The hands-on materials are heavily inspired on the Vulnhub boxes, we picked the most interesting security vulnerabilities based on the infrastructure developer role. This track consist of 5 Basic and 5 Advanced hands-on labs. If you would like to learn more and go deeper into this area we recommend visiting Vulnhub as it's an awesome resource to learn more.
