# Exploitation

An exploit (from the English verb to exploit, meaning "to use something to oneâ€™s own advantage") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service (DoS or related DDoS) attack.

Here is some examples of security tools:

* __Exploit Frameworks__: Metasploit, Core Impact, Cobalt Strike, etc. These tools already have some previously discovered exploits and common features, such as shell listeners, local privilege escalation scripts, hard-coded password controls, etc.
* __Attack Proxies__: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, etc. They give us chance to manipulate HTTP header parameters. Attacks can setup a proxy to intercept HTTP calls and interact with parameters.
* __Vulnerability scanners__: Netsparker, Acunetix, Nikto, etc. can automatically detect security and configuration issues.
