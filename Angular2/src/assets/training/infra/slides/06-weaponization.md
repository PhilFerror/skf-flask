# Weaponization

The weaponization is intended to develop a method of exploiting a discovered weakness. This may include development of custom malware, making use of misconfigurations, identifying known vulnerabilities, crafting a phishing email, typically PDF or Microsoft Office documents can serve as weaponized deliverable for malicious payload, typically by means of an automated tool (weaponizer). Depending on the target and the purpose of the attacker, an attacker can exploit new, undetected vulnerabilities (also known as the zero-day exploits) or it can focus on a combination of different vulnerabilities.

## Application Layers Weaponization

The vulnerabilities detected at application layer frequently rely on complex user inputs. The variety of possible exploiting payloads of a single vulnerability make intrusion detection signature definition a arduous task. This layer is where the user interactions occur, being accessible via standard communication protocols by clients and consumers components and they are, thus, the most exposed to the outside world and the most accessible.
Each of these protocols was designed to provide the function it was built to do and with a lesser focus on security. Malicious users and hackers can compromise both the application that utilizes these protocols and the network protocols themselves.
Regularly targeted application layer services:

- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Telnet
- Secure Shell (SSH)
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
- Domain Name System (DNS)
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Server Message Block (SMB)

How the services can be used by a malicious/weaponized software?
